description: Run pre-release validation checks on all SKILL.md files and JSON databases
---

Run the validation script and report results:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py
```

If any checks fail, list each failure with its file path and what needs fixing. If all checks pass, confirm the repo is release-ready.
